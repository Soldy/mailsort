Since 2008 I have used AI to filter out spam mail. That is relatively simple. Deffenelty after the dkim, dmarc. However, Alphabet and Microsoft have some extra challenges because of a significant amount of spam arriving from their system. The easiest way to fight against that is to measure the meaning difference. And categorizing that. Still relatively simple. 

The question in my mind is not just what is spam and what is not. The question was where they could find my details. I guess is reasonable because to let the details leak is against the gdpr. That needs a little bit more static work.

For that needed a long-term action plan. So I started to fire mouse traps everywhere. Quickly realized much heavier to manage 100 thousand aliases than I expected. The challenge was not the mail filter. The problem was to read fast the filter rules. Most of the filters are easy to read with 10-100 rules. But with 100000 ? That was almost impossible. So need a simplified filter that can be readable at high a complexity level.  

This tool mainly helps for that purpose.
